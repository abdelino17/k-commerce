# k-commerce

K-commerce (short for Kiosk e-commerce) is a next-generation application developed with VueJs and a Backend E-Commerce CMS (Prestashop, but can be extended to Magento, WooCommerce).

The project is a proof-of-concept (POC) aiming at demonstrating how to interconnect a single page application to a Backend CMS (Only Prestashop has been developed) for placing orders.

The project uses many advanced concepts:

- Abstract Classes, Interfaces with Typescript
- Service worker
- Vuex for managing the app's state
- Localstorage
- Inversify library for managing Dependency Injection (DI)
